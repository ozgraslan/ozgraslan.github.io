Ph.D. Computer Science student at Universite de Montreal and student researcher at Quebec Ai Institute (Mila), experienced in reinforcement learning, graph neural networks, robotics and causality. 

My research interests are generalized policies and causal modeling for robotics. In my master's, I worked on reinforcement learning, causal error detection, and correction for assembly tasks. In my bachelor's, I worked on object and gaze detection algorithms and their application to human-robot interaction (HRI) tasks.
